# üìà Anomaly Detection in Distributed Systems

Anomaly detection is essential for maintaining the stability, reliability, and security of distributed systems. This project outlines approaches and techniques for detecting unusual behaviors across nodes and services, helping to prevent system failures, improve reliability, and detect security threats in real-time.

## üîç Overview
Distributed systems are complex, often spread across many servers, cloud instances, and microservices. This project provides a comprehensive guide on anomaly detection methods tailored for distributed systems, enabling early identification of performance bottlenecks, potential failures, and security risks.

## üö® Types of Anomalies

### 1. **Point Anomalies**
   - Individual data points significantly deviate from expected behavior.
   - **Example:** A single, sudden CPU spike.

### 2. **Contextual Anomalies**
   - Data appears abnormal only in specific contexts.
   - **Example:** High CPU during backup windows is normal, but not otherwise.

### 3. **Collective Anomalies**
   - A sequence of data points is abnormal, though individual points may appear normal.
   - **Example:** Sudden response time drop followed by memory increase.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Anomaly Detection Works

1. **Data Collection**: Gather metrics (CPU, memory, latency), logs, and traces across the distributed environment.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize, filter, aggregate, and extract relevant features from raw data.
3. **Pattern Learning (Establishing Baselines)**:
   - **Rule-Based**: Set thresholds.
   - **Statistical**: Calculate baselines using historical data.
   - **Machine Learning**: Use unsupervised or supervised models to learn normal patterns.
   - **Time-Series Analysis**: Identify seasonal trends.
4. **Detection Techniques**: Use rule-based, statistical, or machine learning methods to identify deviations.
5. **Correlation & Root Cause Analysis**: Trace anomalies back to specific sources within the system.
6. **Alerting & Response**: Set up automated alerts and responses, and monitor through dashboards.

## üîç Anomaly Detection Techniques

1. **Rule-Based Detection**: Predefined thresholds for metrics (e.g., CPU > 90%).
2. **Statistical Methods**: Z-scores, variance, and percentile-based detections.
3. **Machine Learning**:
   - **Unsupervised Models**: Clustering, autoencoders.
   - **Supervised Models**: Classifiers (e.g., SVM, random forest).
4. **Time-Series Forecasting**: Predict and flag values deviating from forecasts.

## üöß Challenges in Anomaly Detection

1. **Data Noise**: Filtering out noise while retaining critical indicators.
2. **Concept Drift**: Adapting to evolving system behaviors to prevent false positives.
3. **Latency & Real-Time Processing**: Processing large data volumes quickly.
4. **High False Positives**: Avoiding alert fatigue and prioritizing genuine issues.

## üõ† Tools for Implementation

- **Prometheus**: Metric-based monitoring with alerting.
- **ELK Stack**: Log-based anomaly detection with real-time indexing.
- **Datadog, Dynatrace**: Commercial tools with built-in ML algorithms for distributed monitoring.
- **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing and metrics collection for microservices.
- **Apache Kafka**: Data streaming backbone for real-time anomaly detection pipelines.
