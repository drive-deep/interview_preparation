# Design Patterns

Learn the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns with language-specific implementations.

## Categories

| Category | Patterns | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Creational** | Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype | Object creation |
| **Structural** | Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Composite, Proxy | Object composition |
| **Behavioral** | Strategy, Observer, Command, State, Chain of Responsibility | Object communication |

## Language Implementations

- `go/` - Go-idiomatic implementations
- `python/` - (add later)
- `java/` - (add later)

## Learning Approach

1. Understand the problem the pattern solves (language-agnostic)
2. Study the idiomatic implementation for your target language
3. Implement from scratch without reference
4. Apply in an LLD problem
