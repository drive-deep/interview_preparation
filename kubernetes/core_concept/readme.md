## 🚀 Introduction

Kubernetes, also known as **K8s**, is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. This repository covers the **core concepts** of Kubernetes, offering insights into its architecture and a practical understanding of its components.

## 🧩 Core Components

Here’s an overview of Kubernetes' essential components and concepts:

1. **Cluster**: A group of nodes (machines) that runs your containerized applications.
2. **Node**: The machine (VM or physical) that performs work in the Kubernetes cluster, split into:
   - **Control Plane (Master Node)**: Manages the cluster.
   - **Worker Nodes**: Runs the applications.
3. **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit, usually containing one or more containers.
4. **ReplicaSet**: Ensures the specified number of pod replicas are running.
5. **Deployment**: Manages updates and scaling of applications, providing version control.
6. **Service**: Manages networking, allowing stable access to sets of pods.
7. **Namespaces**: Logical partitions for organizing cluster resources.
8. **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: Configurations and sensitive data management.
9. **Volumes**: Persistent storage for data that survives pod restarts.
10. **Ingress**: Routes external traffic to services in the cluster.
11. **StatefulSet**: Manages stateful applications with persistent identity.
12. **DaemonSet**: Ensures all nodes run a particular pod, ideal for monitoring or logging.
13. **Jobs and CronJobs**: Run specific tasks on demand or on a schedule.
14. **Labels and Selectors**: Organize and target resources based on key-value pairs.

Refer to the [detailed breakdown of each concept](#core-components) for more information.

## 🛠 Setup and Requirements

To get started with Kubernetes, you’ll need:
- **kubectl**: The Kubernetes command-line tool
- **minikube** (for local testing) or access to a cloud provider with Kubernetes support (e.g., GKE, AKS, EKS)
- Basic knowledge of Docker or containerization is recommended

### Installing Minikube and kubectl

1. [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
2. [Install Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

## 💡 Getting Started

After setting up your local environment or cloud Kubernetes cluster, you can create and interact with Kubernetes objects using `kubectl`. Below are a few basic commands to help you get started:

```bash
# Check the cluster's status
kubectl cluster-info

# List all nodes
kubectl get nodes

# Create a deployment
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx

# Expose a deployment to external traffic
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
```

For more advanced examples, check out the [Examples and Usage](#examples-and-usage) section.

## 📝 Examples and Usage

Explore the power of Kubernetes with hands-on examples:
1. **Creating a Deployment**: Define an application’s desired state and let Kubernetes manage it.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: nginx-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: nginx
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: nginx
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: nginx
           image: nginx:1.14.2
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```

2. **Setting up a Service**: Access your application via a stable endpoint.
3. **Configuring Secrets and ConfigMaps**: Separate sensitive data and app settings.
