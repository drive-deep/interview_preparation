## MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)

**Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)** is a concurrency control method used in database systems to handle **simultaneous transactions** without conflicts. MVCC enables the system to maintain **data consistency** and ensure that transactions can operate concurrently without interfering with one another.

### Key Concepts

- **Multiple Versions of Data**: MVCC allows the database to keep multiple versions of the same data to allow for concurrent reads and writes. Each transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the data at a specific point in time, avoiding conflicts between reads and writes.
  
- **Transactions**: Each transaction is treated independently and has a specific **start time** and **end time** (commit time). MVCC allows transactions to proceed in parallel without blocking each other, improving performance.
  
- **Snapshot Isolation**: In MVCC, a transaction operates on a snapshot of the database that was consistent at the time the transaction started. This prevents the transaction from being affected by other transactions that modify data after the transaction's start.

### How MVCC Works

1. **Versioning of Data**:
   - Every data item in the database is versioned with a **timestamp** or **transaction ID** to indicate when it was last modified.
   - When a transaction modifies data, a new version is created with a unique identifier.
   
2. **Reading Data**:
   - When a transaction reads data, it reads the version of the data that was committed before the transaction's start time.
   - This ensures that each transaction works with a **consistent snapshot** of the database, avoiding the issues of dirty reads (reading uncommitted data).

3. **Writing Data**:
   - When a transaction writes data, it does not immediately overwrite the existing data. Instead, a new version of the data is created.
   - The updated version is only visible to the transaction that created it until the transaction commits.
   
4. **Garbage Collection**:
   - Old versions of data are retained until it is safe to delete them (when no active transactions need them). Once a transaction commits or rolls back, the outdated versions can be cleaned up.
   - **Garbage collection** helps ensure that obsolete data versions do not accumulate, reducing storage overhead.

### Benefits of MVCC

- **Non-Blocking Reads**: Reads do not block writes and vice versa, allowing multiple transactions to run concurrently without waiting for each other to finish.
- **Increased Throughput**: Because transactions do not have to wait for each other, MVCC systems tend to offer better performance than systems that rely on locking mechanisms.
- **Consistency**: MVCC ensures that each transaction sees a consistent view of the database, even if other transactions are concurrently modifying the data.

### MVCC in Practice

#### Example

Consider a simple example where two transactions (T1 and T2) try to access and modify the same data:

1. **Transaction T1** begins and reads data version `V1`.
2. **Transaction T2** starts and reads data version `V1` as well.
3. **Transaction T1** updates the data to `V2` and commits.
4. **Transaction T2** attempts to update the same data. Since it is still working with the older version `V1`, it will be prevented from overwriting `V2`. This can lead to **write conflicts**, which MVCC resolves by ensuring that each transaction can only update the version it originally saw.

### Common Use Cases of MVCC

- **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**: MVCC is widely used in relational databases like **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL (InnoDB)**, and **Oracle**. These systems use MVCC to handle concurrent transactions without locking the data, which results in better performance.
- **Distributed Databases**: MVCC is also useful in distributed databases where different nodes may access and modify the same data concurrently.
- **Collaborative Applications**: MVCC can be used in systems where multiple users are simultaneously modifying the same document or resource, like collaborative editing tools.

# Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)

**Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)** is an essential technique for handling concurrent access to data in **distributed systems** and **databases**. It allows multiple transactions to execute in parallel while ensuring **data consistency** and preventing conflicts between read and write operations.

## What is MVCC?

MVCC enables a system to keep multiple versions of data and ensures that transactions work on a consistent **snapshot** of the database, regardless of other concurrent transactions. This prevents issues like **dirty reads**, **non-repeatable reads**, and **phantom reads** while improving performance by allowing non-blocking operations.

## Key Concepts

- **Versioning**: Data is versioned using timestamps or transaction IDs to keep track of changes.
- **Snapshot Isolation**: Transactions operate on a consistent snapshot of data, isolating them from other concurrent transactions.
- **Concurrency**: Multiple transactions can operate simultaneously without blocking each other.

## How MVCC Works

1. **Data Versioning**: Each data item is assigned a version with a unique identifier (e.g., transaction ID or timestamp).
2. **Transaction Reads**: When a transaction reads data, it accesses the version that was committed before the transaction started, ensuring consistency.
3. **Transaction Writes**: Transactions create new versions of data when they modify it. These new versions are only visible to the transaction that created them.
4. **Garbage Collection**: Outdated versions of data are eventually deleted once no active transactions depend on them.

## Benefits of MVCC

- **Non-Blocking Reads**: Reads and writes can occur concurrently without blocking each other.
- **Increased Performance**: MVCC allows multiple transactions to execute in parallel, increasing throughput.
- **Consistency**: Each transaction works with a consistent snapshot of the data, ensuring data integrity.

## Example of MVCC in Action

- **Transaction 1** (T1) starts and reads data version `V1`.
- **Transaction 2** (T2) starts and also reads data version `V1`.
- **Transaction 1** updates data to version `V2` and commits.
- **Transaction 2** tries to update the same data. Since it is working with the outdated version `V1`, it will be prevented from overwriting the newly committed version `V2`.

## Use Cases

- **Relational Databases**: MVCC is widely used in **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL (InnoDB)**, and **Oracle** to handle concurrent transactions efficiently.
- **Distributed Systems**: MVCC is beneficial in distributed databases where multiple nodes need to access and modify the same data simultaneously.
- **Collaborative Applications**: MVCC is also useful in applications where multiple users modify shared resources, such as collaborative document editing tools.

## Conclusion

**MVCC** is a powerful concurrency control technique that allows databases and distributed systems to handle concurrent transactions efficiently while maintaining **data consistency** and **performance**. By using **versioning**, **snapshot isolation**, and **non-blocking operations**, MVCC enables scalable and robust systems capable of handling multiple transactions without data conflicts.

By understanding and implementing MVCC, systems can achieve high **throughput**, **consistency**, and **low latency**, making it an ideal choice for modern, high-performance applications.
