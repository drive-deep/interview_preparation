# Cloud SIEM & Parsing Microservices

## Overview
Cloud SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a scalable, high-performance security event processing system that collects logs from both on-prem and cloud cybersecurity products. The system uses **syslog-ng** for log collection, **parsing microservices** for data processing, and **Elasticsearch** for indexing and searching. Additionally, a **glaciation microservice** periodically removes old data from Elasticsearch and archives it in **AWS S3 Glacier** for cost-effective long-term storage.

## Components
### 1. Syslog-ng Collectors
- Installed on **on-prem** devices and **cloud sources**.
- Collects logs from firewalls, endpoint protection, IDS/IPS, and other security tools.
- Forwards logs to the **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**.

### 2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
- Distributes incoming logs across **multiple parsing microservices**.
- Ensures **high availability** and **scalability**.

### 3. Parsing Microservices
- **Auto-scaled** instances for processing logs in real time.
- **Uses service discovery** (Consul) to dynamically register instances.
- Performs the following transformations:
  - **Parsing:** Converts raw logs into structured format.
  - **Normalization:** Standardizes datetime, floats, integers, strings.
  - **Enrichment:** Adds **GeoIP location** using **MaxMindDB**.
  - **Publishes parsed logs to Kafka for further processing**.

### 4. Kafka
- Acts as a **message broker** between parsing microservices and SIEM components.
- **Decouples Elasticsearch ingestion** to improve scalability.
- **Buffers logs to handle burst traffic efficiently**.

### 5. Elasticsearch
- Stores parsed and enriched logs for **fast searching and correlation**.
- Used by **SIEM analytics** to detect anomalies and security incidents.

### 6. Cloud SIEM Components
- **Correlation Engine:** Identifies patterns and links security events.
- **Rules Engine:** Applies pre-defined security policies to detect threats.
- **Alerting System:** Generates security alerts based on detected anomalies.
- **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response):** Automates incident response workflows.

### 7. Glaciation Microservice
- Periodically removes **old logs** from Elasticsearch.
- **Archives logs to AWS S3 Glacier** for cost-efficient long-term retention.

## Scaling & Performance
- **Auto-Scaling:** Parsing microservices scale dynamically based on log volume.
- **Service Discovery:** **Consul** manages instance registration for load balancing.
- **Kafka Decoupling:** Enables **elastic scaling** of Elasticsearch ingestion.
- **Batch Writing:** Uses a buffering mechanism to **reduce Elasticsearch write load**.
- **High Availability:** Logs are distributed using **NLB**, ensuring redundancy.

## Technologies Used
- **Golang** for high-performance microservices.
- **Syslog-ng** for log collection.
- **Network Load Balancer (AWS NLB)** for traffic distribution.
- **Consul** for service discovery and dynamic scaling.
- **Kafka** for log streaming and decoupling.
- **Elasticsearch** for log indexing and search.
- **MaxMindDB** for **GeoIP enrichment**.
- **AWS S3 Glacier** for long-term log archiving.

## Deployment Considerations
- **Use Kubernetes** (EKS, GKE, AKS) for deploying auto-scaling microservices.
- **Monitor system health** with Prometheus & Grafana.
- **Implement log rotation & retention policies** in Elasticsearch.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integrate machine learning models** for anomaly detection.
- **Add support for OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing.
- **Optimize cost by leveraging tiered storage solutions**.
